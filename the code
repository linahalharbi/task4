this is the code i use to controll the dc motor in both dircetion clockwise and counter clockwise 

void setup() //runs once 
{
  pinMode(6, OUTPUT); //output info as moving motors //set pin as output for relay 1
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);//set pin as output for relay 2
}

void loop()// runs continously 
{
   // Rotate in CW direction
  digitalWrite(6, HIGH); //turn relay 1 OFF
  digitalWrite(5, LOW);//turn relay 2 ON
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s)
 // Rotate in CCW direction
  digitalWrite(6, LOW); //turn relay 1 ON
  digitalWrite(5, HIGH);//turn relay 2 OFF
  delay(1000); // Wait for 1000 millisecond(s) 
}
